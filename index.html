            <p class="para">In “Naruto”, the viewers are introduced to the protagonist who is named Naruto Uzumaki. In the beginning, Naruto Uzumaki was a kid who was reckless and caused trouble to the grown-ups not caring about the consequences. He is proven troublesome toward the grownups while he lived in the village. In the anime, Naruto has blonde hair that is spiky and blue eyes. He also has some form of whiskers on the sides of his face. He wore an orange jumpsuit and wore a pair of goggles on his head to substitute as a head protector that is given to shinobis when they pass a test in school.</p>

I think you could have changed father and mother. Perhaps even the entire Uchiha. If I would have stood in front of you and looked you in the eyes from the very beginning... talked to you instead of down to you... and been open about everything. But I failed, and speaking to you now, like this, isn't going to undo the permanent damage that's already been done to you. That's why I wanted to show you the truth. Even if it's just a little. And no matter what you decide to do from here on out, you never have to forgive me - I will always love you."</p>
